# Before You Start

You will have to download the data files separately, this is mostly just to keep the files off Github.

This is helped by the `.gitignore`, so don't delete that, or change that without reason. Download them with the basic
names, if you're not sure what those are, then check `graph_processing.py'`

You can download the necessary files from "https://datasets.imdbws.com/"

The LaTeX folder is added, and the `.gitignore` has a lot of files to ignore. These are from my personal LaTeX
processor, which aren't very useful. I have decided to leave out the `pdf` part of the LaTeX for now, and that can be
changed later. For now, it is just copy and pasted from the first part of this project.

If you're not sure what to do, then I have marked unfnished things with `# TODO`, search for them with whatever method
you prefer.

Remember to run the `sql_processing.py` file to gain access to the database. Play with it, we need to figure out how to
properly query it. To use the script, you need the necessary files downloaded. Might add smaller files later for testing
purposes...
